Hello everyone!
I extracted an iOS 15 restore image by giving it the extension tar.gz and extracting it. I found something interesting within that I was attemping to take a look at. 
kernelcache.release.iphone9 was the original file from said iOS image. I'm able to view the hex code in both wireshark and VS code but have been unable to disassemble it. 
Can someone more qualified disassemble it and release it as a contrabution to this repo or walk me through how to do it myself? 
THANK YOU!
